# fave-teaching-resources
A list of some of my favorite resources for teaching technology, R, and other things

Please add any resources with a pull request, if you so desire!

## Sample curriculum

- [Introduction to Data Science](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring18/Sta199/), Mine Centinkaya-Rundel: from the creator of the [data-science-in-a-box curriculum](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box), this is fantastic! And her other courses [here](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~mc301/teaching/)...
- [Data Science in A Box Curriculum](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box): as mentioned above, by RStudio
- [Computing for the Social Sciences](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/), Ben Soltoff: this is one of the first data analysis open source curricula to come out of the MACSS program at UChicago
- An [index of courses using R](https://github.com/rstudio-education/rstats-ed), put together by RStudio

## Pedagogy and teaching tech

- [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech), Greg Wilson: the book that came out of the Software Carpentry initative; truly one of the best books I've read for teaching tech
- [Let them eat cake (first)!](https://speakerdeck.com/minecr/let-them-eat-cake-first-0a3bbf75-f6f1-42d5-8d2f-ac2ff741611f): One idea of how to approach the data science teaching
- [Explicit Direct Instruction in Programming Education](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/opening-keynote-day2): why don't we explicitly teach people how to program? Insightful talk that I've been thinking about a lot
- Teaching reproducible spatial analysis using R, [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quFhQvizBE8&t=19492s), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14HtS-1c3A0GBIVvfrYkOrARwlJIqo2rkOAb2Du81eTw/edit: *warning: self promotion* me, reflecting on things about teaching I've learned while slightly sleep deprived
